# Introduction

Welcome to **Docs Starter Kit** - an open-source documentation platform built with Laravel, Vue.js, and TypeScript using Inertia.js.

## What is Docs Starter Kit?

Docs Starter Kit is a modern, feature-rich documentation platform that you can clone and customize for your own projects. It provides everything you need to create beautiful, functional documentation websites.

### Key Features

- **Dual Content Mode**: Choose between Git-based synchronization or Database CMS

- **SEO Optimized**: Built-in meta tags, sitemaps, and structured data
- **Version History**: Track changes and restore previous versions

## Why Inertia.js?

Docs Starter Kit uses Inertia.js to combine the best of both worlds:

- **No API needed**: Direct communication between Laravel controllers and Vue components
- **SPA experience**: Client-side navigation without full page reloads
- **Simple state management**: Props from Laravel replace complex state stores
- **SEO friendly**: Server-side rendering support for documentation pages
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support from backend to frontend
- **Form handling**: Built-in form helpers with validation error handling
